        Designed and developed a robust web application utilizing React.js, catering to the complex functionalities of company management. The application features an intuitive admin interface allowing the creation of companies, importing employee lists, and assigning roles seamlessly. Admin users have the ability to streamline operations efficiently. Authorized users can upload payroll lists in PDF format for their respective companies, along with TC identification number. The system performs a matching process against the user lists, ensuring precise alignment. Each user is then automatically allocated their corresponding payroll information, creating a streamlined and automated process for efficient payroll management within the platform. This project underscores my proficiency in creating comprehensive and user-centric web applications that facilitate seamless data management and user interaction.
