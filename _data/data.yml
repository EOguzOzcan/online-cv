        Actively contributing to a KOSGEB-supported Complex Event Processing (CEP) project written in Java, I played a hands-on role in a team of three individuals with diverse expertise. My primary focus was on frontend development, where I actively engaged in tasks like creating responsive designs, managing HTTPS requests, and implementing user interfaces.
